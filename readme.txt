== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have installed the plugin but i can't see any admin options page. Where is it? =

Ehm.. this is my first release of my first plugin, in next versions i will ad an option page with various options. 

= What about customizing the comments page? =

This is a simple task. This plugin use the template `comments-nggallery.php` inside `plugins/nextgen-gallery-comments/template` to show comments list and form.
If you want to customize it, copy it and paste in your theme inside `nggallery` folder (if this not exists, create it. This folder is needed to customize [NextGEN Gallery templates](http://nextgen-gallery.com/templates/))
